# Results
  Best Performing Model: [Model Name] with an R² score of [Value] and RMSE of [Value].
  Key Insights:
  Feature X is the most significant predictor of car prices.
  Cars older than Y years tend to have significantly lower prices.
# Future Scope
  Integration of real-time market trends and data.
  Addition of features like car condition, insurance status, and fuel economy.
  Optimization of prediction models for better accuracy.
  Mobile-friendly UI for broader accessibility.
